summary: Set up AWS PrivateLink between OpenFlow on SPCS and private data sources like RDS or on-prem databases.
description: |
  Use when configuring private connectivity from Snowflake OpenFlow (running on SPCS) to AWS-hosted or on-premises data sources via AWS PrivateLink. Covers NLB + VPC Endpoint Service on AWS, then SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT, network rules, and External Access Integration on Snowflake. AWS only (Public Preview also exists on Azure but is out of scope here). Triggers: OpenFlow PrivateLink, SPCS private connectivity, NLB for OpenFlow, EAI for OpenFlow, SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT, OpenFlow RDS, OpenFlow MySQL, OpenFlow PostgreSQL, private ingestion OpenFlow, SPCS egress.

## Overview

Connect OpenFlow on SPCS to private data sources (RDS, on-prem DBs reachable via Direct Connect/VPN) through AWS PrivateLink. The flow:

```
OpenFlow (SPCS) → EAI → Network Rule (PRIVATE_HOST_PORT)
                  → Outbound PrivateLink Endpoint
                  → AWS VPC Endpoint Service → Internal NLB
                  → Target Group(s) → RDS / on-prem DB (via TCP proxy if needed)
```

Each NLB listener uses a unique port (any port > 1024) so multiple instances sharing the same backend port (e.g., two MySQL on 3306) can be disambiguated.

## Prerequisites

- AWS permissions: NLB, target groups, endpoint services, security groups
- Snowflake `ACCOUNTADMIN`
- OpenFlow already deployed on SPCS
- One or more data sources in a private VPC (or on-prem with VPC connectivity)

## Phase 1 — AWS infrastructure

1. **Target groups (IP type)** — one per database, TCP on the DB port, registered with the private IP of each instance (or a TCP proxy EC2 IP if the source is on-prem with non-RFC1918 addresses).
2. **Internal NLB** — TCP listeners on unique custom ports (e.g., 3301, 3302), each forwarding to its target group. Enable cross-zone load balancing. Set `dns_record.client_routing_policy=any_availability_zone`.
3. **VPC Endpoint Service** — fronts the NLB. Keep manual acceptance enabled (default).

⚠️ STOPPING POINT: Confirm `describe-target-health` shows `healthy` and the NLB state is `active` before continuing. Record `nlb_dns_name`, `endpoint_service_name`, and listener ports.

On-prem targets outside RFC1918/RFC6598 ranges require a single TCP proxy EC2 (NGINX/HAProxy/Envoy in TCP mode) registered into the target groups.

## Phase 2 — Snowflake side

1. Get Snowflake's account principal:
   ```sql
   SELECT key, value FROM TABLE(FLATTEN(INPUT => PARSE_JSON(SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG())));
   ```
   Add the `privatelink-account-principal` ARN to the endpoint service's allowed principals via `aws ec2 modify-vpc-endpoint-service-permissions`.

2. Provision the endpoint:
   ```sql
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
   SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT('<endpoint_service_name>', '<nlb_dns_name>');
   ```

3. Accept the pending connection in AWS (`aws ec2 accept-vpc-endpoint-connections`).

⚠️ STOPPING POINT: Run `SELECT SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO();` and wait until `status` is `available` (30–40s) before creating the network rule.

4. Network rule + EAI:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE <rule_name>
     MODE = EGRESS
     TYPE = PRIVATE_HOST_PORT
     VALUE_LIST = ('<nlb_dns_name>:<port1>', '<nlb_dns_name>:<port2>');

   CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION <eai_name>
     ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (<rule_name>)
     ENABLED = TRUE;
   ```

5. In OpenFlow UI: Runtime console → `...` → **Associate External Access Integration** → pick `<eai_name>`.

6. Validate by pointing a connector at `<nlb_dns_name>:<listener_port>`.

## Common Mistakes

- **Reusing a backend port as the NLB listener port** when multiple instances share it — listeners must be unique.
- **Uppercase letters in `VALUE_LIST`** — the NLB FQDN must be lowercase, otherwise `Invalid VALUE_LIST`.
- **Forgetting to accept the AWS endpoint connection** — the endpoint stays in `pendingAcceptance` forever.
- **Skipping the account-principal allowlist** — `SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT` will fail.
- **Security group on RDS not allowing the NLB's SG** on the DB port — target health flips unhealthy.
- **Deleting the NLB before deprovisioning** the Snowflake endpoint — leaves a dangling endpoint.
- **On-prem IPs outside RFC1918/RFC6598** registered directly — NLB rejects; use a TCP proxy EC2 instead.
- **Using `PRIVATE_HOST_PORT` against the DB hostname** — use the NLB DNS name, not the database's.

## Troubleshooting quick reference

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Endpoint stuck `pendingAcceptance` | Accept it in AWS VPC > Endpoint Services |
| Targets unhealthy | RDS/proxy SG inbound from NLB SG on DB port |
| `Invalid VALUE_LIST` | NLB DNS must be lowercase |
| Endpoint `failed` | `SYSTEM$DEPROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT` then re-provision; `SYSTEM$RESTORE_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT` recovers within 7 days |
| Traffic drops despite healthy targets | VPC NACLs: inbound listener ports, outbound 1024–65535 |

## Cleanup

⚠️ STOPPING POINT: Confirm with the user before running any `DROP` / `delete-*` commands below.

Order matters — Snowflake first, then AWS:

1. OpenFlow UI: disassociate EAI from runtime.
2. `DROP EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION <eai_name>; DROP NETWORK RULE <rule_name>;`
3. `SELECT SYSTEM$DEPROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT('<endpoint_service_name>');`
4. `aws ec2 delete-vpc-endpoint-service-configurations`, then delete NLB, then target groups.

## Stopping Points

- Phase 1 — wait for healthy targets and active NLB before creating the endpoint service
- Phase 2 step 3 — wait until `SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO()` returns `available` before creating the network rule
- Cleanup — confirm with the user before running any destructive `DROP` / `delete-*` commands

## Cost note

NLB (hourly + LCU), VPC Endpoint Service (hourly), PrivateLink endpoint (hourly + per-GB), and cross-zone data transfer all incur AWS charges. Check current AWS pricing.
