# PNDSPY1152

Element has a partial mapping but there are a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

Message: Pandas < ***pandas.core.indexes.datetimes.date_range*** > has a partial mapping with a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

Category: Warning.

## Description

This issue appears when the SMA detects the use of a Pandas element that has a direct equivalent in Snowpark Pandas, but some scenarios might behave differently than Pandas.


**Reason (from Snowpark documentation):** N for custom frequencies

## Scenario

**Input**

Below is an example of a method with a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
result = pd.date_range(df)
```

**Output**

The SMA adds the EWI `PNDSPY1152` on the output code to let you know that this element has a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

```python
import snowflake.snowpark.modin.pandas as pd

#EWI: PNDSPY1152 => pandas.core.indexes.datetimes.date_range has a partial mapping, with few scenarios not supported. Check Snowpark Pandas documentation for more detail.
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
result = pd.date_range(df)
```

**Recommended fix**

**Behavioral note**: N for custom frequencies

This behavior may differ from native Pandas. Recommended actions:
- Test with a representative sample of your data
- Compare results with native Pandas if precision is critical
- Use `.to_pandas()` if exact Pandas behavior is required

## Additional recommendations

- Check the [Snowpark Pandas documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/modin/supported/index) to verify which scenarios are not supported for that specific element.
